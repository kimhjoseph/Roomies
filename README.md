# Roomies

Roomies is a web platform used by roommates to make their lives easier.

To start the application, simply run `npm start`.

Before running the application run npm install in the root directory, frontend directory and backend directory to install all required dependencies. 

To generate the JSDoc documentation simply navigate to the backend/routes directory and run npm install -g jsdoc. Then you can generate documentation for any file using jsdoc <file_name> <additional file names separated by a single space>. This will produce a folder named out in the routes directory with the HTML files containing the generated documentation.
